# Drowsiness Detection System Using Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project focuses on building a **Drowsiness Detection System** to reduce accidents caused by driver fatigue. It uses a webcam connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 to monitor facial features in real-time, analyzing the **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** and **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)** to detect signs of drowsiness or yawning. Alerts are triggered to warn the driver.

## Objectives
- Develop a cost-effective and portable drowsiness detection system.
- Implement real-time video processing for facial feature analysis.
- Detect drowsiness and yawning based on EAR and MAR calculations.
- Provide instant alerts to reduce accident risks.

## Features
- Real-time facial analysis using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **dlib**.
- Affordable and compact system leveraging Raspberry Pi.
- Applications in vehicle safety, workplace monitoring, and healthcare.
